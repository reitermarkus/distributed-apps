# Homework 2

## Dependencies

- `gradle`
- `node`/`npm`
- `ibmcloud`
- `awscli`

## Running

Deploy and run the functions using `./deploy.sh`.

Try in a browser (takes approx. 5 - 30 seconds):

- https://eu-gb.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/62ea098b-618c-465f-8bed-aa659df82e70/default/nqueens-x2faas.json?num_queens=8&from=0&to=16777216

## Manual FaaSification vs. X2FaaS

For manual FaaSification, I changed `nqueen.js` to only run in
command-line mode if it isn't required as a module. That way,
I could now `require` it in a new `index.js` and call the
`fraction` function using a wrapper function with the appropriate
signatures for both IBM and AWS. This took about half an hour.

The automatic FaaSification using X2FaaS took me about 4 hours
because, let's just say, it isn't self-explanatory.

## Results

| Region   | Type   | N | Memory | Time (`curl`) | Time (Java) |
|----------|--------|---|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `eu-gb`  | manual | 8 | 128 MB |       6957 ms |     7371 ms |
| `eu-gb`  | x2faas | 8 | 128 MB |      21989 ms |     7375 ms |

Looking at the results, we can see that when using `curl`, the
function which was manually FaaSified is about three times faster
than the function generated by the X2FaaS tool. However, when using
Java using jFaaS to call the functions, both perfom identically.
