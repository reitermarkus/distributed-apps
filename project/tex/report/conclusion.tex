\chapter{\label{chap:conclusion}Conclusion \& Future Work}

In this project, we built a serverless system to predict the stock prices for the next day using historical data. Multiple stock ticker symbols are passed as input and as output, a graph is generated showing the predicted prices. This simplifies and automates multiple tasks that would have to be done manually for each stock.

% TODO: State your contributions. Use the numbers from the experimental evaluation to provide evidence of the improvement resulting from your work.

\section{Future Work}

Future work on this project would definitely include finding an alternative solution to
AWS Forecast which does not require such an elaborate setup for predicting prices.
Due to the complicated API we only became aware of this issue after we had already
implemented the bulk of the forecast function in both Rust and JavaScript, which is why
we did not have time to find another forecasting solution which works in both languages.

\section{Recommendations for the VU in the Future}

I kindly ask you for a feedback regarding:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The homeworks were fairly straight-forward to solve, however sometimes quite time-consuming.

    \item The project was quite interesting and also fairly straight-forward to implement,
          however using AWS Forecast and two languages took a lot more time than anticipated.

    \item Would you like to focus on multiple FaaS systems from the beginning with multiple cloud services (e.g. IBM Watson, Google AI, â€¦)? \\
          No, the platform is not that important, so a single one is fine.

    \item Is the depth of the selected topics appropriate? \\
          Yes.

    \item Are the selected topics appropriate? \\
          Yes.

    \item What would you like to learn more? \\
          Kubernetes

    \item What would you like to be removed from the course? \\
          Java
\end{itemize}
