\section{Testing methodology}

Describe the experiment setup you used to obtain the evaluation results (used FaaS systems, regions, function deployments, number of experiment repetitions, measured metrics, etc.).

Make sure that you provide enough details to make the experiment reproducible.

\section{Evaluation}

Present and discuss the results. Show some chart - makespan for each FC deployment, as well as from the scheduled FC. 

Explain the insights provided by the experiments. Explain outliers, if present. 
This part of the report should provide evidence that the previously formulated project objectives are achieved with your implementation of the FC.

If results are not as expected, discuss why.

Discuss some findings from your measurements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item good/bad scheduler
    \item (not)expected speedup
    \item some observations per provider, per region, per function type, per function implementation, per function deployment
\end{itemize}
