\section{FC Implementation in AFCL}

Describe your FC (AFCL):
\begin{itemize}
    \item present a figure of your AFCL (you can use FC Editor)
    \item describe dataIns/outs inside the FC
    \item describe FC functions (function types)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item dataIns
        \item dataOuts
        \item purpose within the overall FC
    \end{itemize}
    \item explain compound functions
\end{itemize}

Discuss the FC complexity and the opportunities for distribution.

\section{Scheduler}

Briefly describe how your scheduler works:
\begin{itemize}
    \item inputs
    \item algorithm
    \item outputs
\end{itemize}



%
%
%
\section{FC Implementation in CFCL}

Describe your resulting FC (CFCL):
\begin{itemize}
    \item present a figure of your CFCL representation (you can use FC Editor)
    \item briefly describe changes from AFCL to CFCL
    \item describe which function deployments were selected by the scheduler
\end{itemize}

Discuss the CFCL complexity and expected theoretical speedup.

\section{Automatic Deployment}

\textcolor{magenta}{one paragraph}

Describe specifics of your deployment script (which tool, which services do you deploy automatically, etc)



%
%
%
\section{Fault tolerance}

\textcolor{magenta}{one paragraph}

If you use fault tolerance in your FC, describe which functions are monitored and which constructs are used.

\section{Helper tools from you}

Mention developed tools by you to help you to manage:
\begin{itemize}
    \item logs from \textit{xAFCL}
    \item parse AFCL and create CFCL
    \item parse AFCL and create CFCL
\end{itemize}
